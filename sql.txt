Sql description?
    SQL can execute queries against a database
    SQL can retrieve data from a database
    SQL can insert records in a database
    SQL can update records in a database
    SQL can delete records from a database

vertical data in a table FIELDS(columns)
horizental data in a table RECORDS(rows)

SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT

Semicolon[;] is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database 
systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

THIS keywords  ARE IMPORTANT
    SELECT - extracts data from a database
    UPDATE - updates data in a database
    DELETE - deletes data from a database
    INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
    CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
    ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
    CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
    ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
    DROP TABLE - deletes a table
    CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
    DROP INDEX - deletes an index

SELECT statement syntax:
    select column1,column2 .. from table_name;
SELECT distinct syntax:
    The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) is not supported in Microsoft Access databases.

SQL WHERE CLAUSE:
    The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;

The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!

Operators : between,in, like

SQL Order By keyword:
 The Order by keyword is used to sort the result in ascending or descending Order
syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
 ASC / DESC
SQL AND operator:
 The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition
syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
SQL OR operator:
 The OR operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition
syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
Ex:SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');

 Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Spain that starts with a "G", 
 plus all customers that starts with an "R", regardless of the country value:
SQL NOT operator:
 The NOT operator is used in combination with other operators to 
 give the opposite result, also called the negative result.
syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE NOT condition;
SQL Insert into:
 The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted:
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, 
you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query
    INSERT INTO table_name
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
It is also possible to insert multiple rows in one statement.

SQL NULL value:
    A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.
    A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. 
    A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!
IS null syntax:
    SELECT column_names
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IS NULL;
SQL update statement:
 The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
update syntax:
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

update multiple records;
SQL DELETE statement:
    The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
delete syntax:
    DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
delete all RECORDS(rows):
It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. 
 This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes
    syntax:DELETE FROM table_name;
 To delete permently table:
 DROP TABLE table_name;

 SQl select top clause:
 The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return
 Note:Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. 
 MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, 
 while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.

 MySQL syntax:
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT number;
SQL TOP percent Example:
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

SQL min() and max() functions:
The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.
The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.
syntax:
    SELECT MIN(column_name)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
AS keyword:
 set a alias name 

SQl COUNT:The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.
 NULL values will not be counted.
syntax:
    SELECT COUNT(column_name)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
SQl SUM:
The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column.
syntax:
 SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
